# BankingApp
The Banking Project is a simple Java-based application that simulates core banking operations. It allows users to log in with credentials, deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds with OTP verification. The system ensures balance validation, logs all transactions into a file, and provides secure, self-service banking features.
